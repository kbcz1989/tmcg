### Example Command

```bash
./tmcg -p hashicorp/aws:>=3.0 -r aws_instance:single -d ./output -l debug
```

### Output Files

- **`main.tf`**: Contains resource definitions with dynamic blocks.
- **`variables.tf`**: Defines input variables for the resources.
- **`versions.tf`**: Specifies required providers and their versions.

## Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
make test
```

### Key Test Features

- Verifies resource and provider parsing.
- Ensures `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `versions.tf` generation matches expectations.
- Validates cleanup of HCL files and schema handling.

## How `tmcg` Works

1. **Parsing Provider and Resource Arguments**
   - The tool takes arguments for providers and resources passed via CLI flags.
   - Providers can be specified with optional versions (e.g., `hashicorp/aws:>=3.0`).
   - Resources are parsed with an optional mode (`single` or `multiple`), defaulting to `multiple`.

2. **Building `versions.tf`**
   - The tool constructs a `versions.tf` file based on the provided provider arguments.
   - The file specifies provider sources and version constraints.

3. **Running `terraform init`**
   - Once the `versions.tf` file is created, `tmcg` runs `terraform init` to download required providers.
   - This ensures that all dependencies are in place before schema processing.

4. **Fetching Terraform Provider Schema**
   - The tool fetches the full schema for the specified providers using `terraform providers schema`.
   - This includes details of attributes, blocks, and their metadata (e.g., required, computed, optional).

5. **Filtering the Schema for Parsed Resources**
   - From the fetched schema, only the resources specified via CLI arguments are retained.
   - This narrows down the schema to the required subset.

6. **Removing Computed-Only Attributes**
   - The filtered schema is further refined by removing attributes that are only computed and cannot be configured by users.

7. **Generating `main.tf` and `variables.tf`**
   - Based on the filtered schema, `tmcg` generates:
     - **`main.tf`**: A skeleton configuration for resources with all possible attributes.
     - **`variables.tf`**: A file specifying the input variable types for Terraform.

8. **Running `terraform validate`**
   - After generating the configuration files, `tmcg` runs `terraform validate` to check for errors or warnings.
   - This step helps identify any invalid or unsupported attributes.

9. **Removing Invalid Attributes**
   - If validation errors are detected, `tmcg` analyzes the errors and removes invalid attributes from the filtered schema.
   - The process ensures the configuration adheres to the schema and Terraform constraints.

10. **Re-running Generation**
    - With the refined schema, `tmcg` regenerates `main.tf` and `variables.tf`.
    - This ensures the configurations are correct after invalid attributes are removed.

11. **Running `terraform fmt`**
    - The tool formats the generated Terraform configuration files for better readability and consistency.

12. **Final Validation**
    - A final `terraform validate` is executed to confirm the validity of the configurations.

## Real-World Scenario

Imagine you are tasked with writing a Terraform module for deploying resources, such as AWS instances or Azure resources. Crafting such modules can be a daunting task because:

1. **You need to understand the resource schema in-depth or read docs line by line**: Terraform provider resources often support dozens of attributes, some required, others optional, and many computed.
2. **Ensuring flexibility**: To make a module reusable, you must expose configurable parameters for all relevant resource attributes.
3. **Keeping up with upstream changes**: Terraform providers are frequently updated, and your module must remain compatible with the latest schema.

This is where `tmcg` can be helpful.

### How `tmcg` Solves This Problem

`tmcg` generates Terraform module boilerplate code by leveraging Terraform provider schemas directly. Its approach is guided by the author's subjective best practices, emphasizing flexibility and extensibility:

- **Comprehensive attribute support**: All attributes supported by the upstream provider are included in the generated code, ensuring you donâ€™t miss any critical options.
- **Baseline for further customization**: The generated module serves as a starting point, which you can refine and extend to meet specific requirements.
- **Automated validation and cleanup**: It automatically validates and filters out computed-only attributes that should not be user-configurable.

For example, if you want to create a module for an AWS EC2 instance, instead of manually crafting the `variables.tf` and `main.tf`, you can run `tmcg` and instantly get:

1. A `variables.tf` with all attributes defined and ready for customization.
2. A `main.tf` implementing these variables with proper references.
3. A `versions.tf` that enforces the required providers and Terraform version.

### Example Workflow

#### 1. Define Resources and Providers

Use `tmcg` to specify resources and providers for your module. For instance:

```bash
tmcg --resource aws_instance:single --provider "hashicorp/aws:>=4.0" --directory my-module
```

#### 2. Review and Expand

Navigate to the `my-module` directory, where youâ€™ll find:

- `versions.tf`: Ensures compatibility with the required Terraform version and provider version.
- `variables.tf`: Includes all possible attributes for the `aws_instance` resource.
- `main.tf`: Implements the logic based on the variables.

From here, you can further tailor the module to fit your use case.

#### 3. Validate and Apply

Run Terraform commands to validate and test the module:

```bash
terraform init
terraform validate
```

`tmcg` ensures the code is clean and adheres to best practices, reducing manual effort and errors.

### Benefits

- **Time-saving**: Quickly generate a baseline for Terraform modules, avoiding repetitive tasks.
- **Up-to-date**: Leverage the latest upstream provider schemas to ensure compatibility with the newest features.
- **Customization-friendly**: The generated code is easy to expand and customize, making it suitable for real-world use.

### Real-World Use Case

A DevOps/TechOps engineer responsible for setting up cloud infrastructure can use `tmcg` to:

1. Generate a module for managing EC2 instances.
2. Quickly iterate over configurations for different environments (e.g., staging, production) by modifying the generated `variables.tf`.
3. Stay compatible with the latest AWS provider by regenerating the module as provider schemas evolve.

By streamlining the module creation process, `tmcg` lets you focus on high-value tasks like optimizing resource configurations and scaling infrastructure.
